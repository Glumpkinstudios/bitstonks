# Bitstonks

is a StreamElements plugin that brings a bit of fun into TTS pricing. It will modify the price of TTS based on the time (how long you keep it running) and how many bits were used during the stream.

It is a widget that plays TTS message if the price matches (is greater) than the price calculated so make sure to disable your bits TTS elements first.

# Usage

- Go to your StreamElements overlay.
- Add (+) > Static / Custom > Custom widget > Open Editor.
- Paste contents of each file into corresponding tab.
- Configure and done.

Alternatively you can try to import this overlay https://streamelements.com/dashboard/overlays/share/684b15f3bfe6dfd10c76fd89 and duplicate the widget to your overlay.
